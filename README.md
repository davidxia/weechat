# Setup

Install weechat. Git clone into ~/.weechat, make appropriate changes below, and
start the client.

Modify irc.conf

  * change nicks, username
  * change "organization"
  * change organization.autojoin

Some shortcuts:
  * alt + 1-10 -> channel 1-10
  * alt + q,w,e,r,t -> channel 11-15
  * alt + p/n -> previous/next page
  * ctrl + p/n -> previous/next channel
  * alt + b/f -> back/forth in user list
  * alt +a -> smart jump (next channel that highlights you, etc)

To make alt key bindings behave well for Mac OS X iTerm2, go to
Preferences->Profiles->Keys and click +Esc radio button for option keys.
